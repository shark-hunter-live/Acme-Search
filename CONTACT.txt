## Security advisory (informational)

**Advisory ID:** ACME-2025-001  
**Severity:** Medium/High (depends on deployment exposure)  
**Affected versions:** v1.0 (known), v1.1 patched the primary issue.

**Description:**  
Versions of AcmeSearch Agent prior to v1.1 performed naive command-line construction when executing log searches — under certain configurations the agent passed user-supplied search terms directly into a shell-invoked `grep` command. If the agent is exposed to untrusted networks (or used behind management networks without strong access controls), a crafted search term could be used to cause unintended shell execution.

**Mitigation / Workaround:**
- Upgrade to v1.1 or later (v1.3 recommended).
- Ensure the agent is never exposed to public networks; limit access via firewall/Security Groups to trusted management IPs only.
- Run the agent under a dedicated, low-privilege OS account (do not run as root).
- Audit system logs and look for suspicious commands issued near agent activity.

**Notes for operators:**  
When investigating potential issues with older agents, look for the daemon banner:
